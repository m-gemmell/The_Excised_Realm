    "text": "Inis Ocular\n\nPronounced: Inn-ish Awk-you-lar\nEtymology: Inis is island in irish, ocular is related to eyes\nLocation:\nImportance: Trade port for the realm to other realms across the sea. Trade only occurs here to quarantine merchants from other realms.\n\nInis Ocular is known for its observatory and has been taken over by the “Emerald lights” religion. They use the observatory to try to look out for the emerald lights in the sky. The leader is Mentha the Mint (they/them).\nThe official ruler, The Shield Knight, lives in a small garden house in the hallowed garden. Here, grows the alien flower, Trillium Blaschkanum (Blaschka known for the glass flowers). Each flower is spit into three from the stem to the head. Each third has one triangular petal and various triangular leaves. The thirds are connected by thin fibres. All of it looks quite glass-like and one third is coloured emerald, another third a dark iridescent, and the third a yellow colour. The leaves are fed to silk moth larvae producing green, black, or yellow silk depending on the leaves they eat. The silks possibly have other effects.\nThe Shield Knight is blackmailed by mehta the Mint to let the Emerald lights rule. This is because they have evidence of The Shield Knight skimming wealth off the top from the trade that passes through.\nAdditionally, there are a lot of leather workers as lots of leather is received from other realms through trade.\nUsed Prompts Holding features Sage’s Den Bailey includes Hallowed garden Keep holds observatory Food is wet pie Goods are abundant leather Luxuries are esoteric silk Drama involves coup through blackmail Woe is unseen fire News of tournament mood content",

    "text": "Pronounced: Fa-bree-knock\nEtymology: Fabir is old french for forge, knock is irish for hill\nLocation: R5-C12\nImportance: Primary source of forged metals in the realm\n\n\n\nConstant hammering rings through the bailey. It originates from the blacksmiths in a large white chimney like building. A thick deep purple metal rod runs far into the earth providing a mighty heat.\nMany blacksmiths work here due to the free heat. Aside from the source of heat there is nothing else special about the forge and its output.\n\n\n\nTo match the blacksmiths many rivalling workshops exist in Fabriknock. They make all manner of contraptions and jewellery from the metals of the forge. They are especially fond of using the green pearls from the green bees.\nThe various wares are sold in market stalls surrounding the forge. The realm’s Merchants come here to buy these goods and then sell them at Inis Ocular.\n\n\n\nStrange radial 3 petalled and 3 stemmed flowers exist in the surrounding area (Trillium Baumuum; trillium is a flower, Frank Baum wrote the wizard of oz). Although they are beautiful with their emerald petals and glass like appearance they are forbidden to be picked.\nThe flowers are used by the bee keepers. The bees that use its pollen produce a chartreuse honey that is sold as a luxury. Beehives are built into the wood walls of the town so the beekeepers can extract honey from inside the walls without walking on the flowers.\nAdditionally, bees end up growing a green emerald inside their body. These are extracted and used by the various makers in the workshops.\n\n\n\nInside the Keep of multi coloured rocks they keep a reliquary. This is the whole skeleton of the Green Eyed Seer. It is of high significance for the Emerald Lights religion who was seen as a sort of Demigod for their religion.\nThe skeleton looks like that of a “little grey man”. It is protected by The Leaf Knight. The Moat Knight sent it to be protected by The Leaf Knight as a power move against Salvia the Sage. The Leaf Knight is The Moat Knight’s child.\n\n\n\nThe denizens of the holding have fractured. There have been brawls and killings. It seems senseless to the guards and those in the Keep. But it is not senseless.\nMany of the holding want to steal the skeleton of the Green Seer to give to The Eagle (myth). This seems to be turning into a new religion that worships the sun.\nThe other side follows the Emerald Lights religion and so do not want their reliquary to be given away.\n\n\n\n\nHolding features bright forge\nBailey includes rustic workshops\nKeep holds reliquary with bones\nFood is chewy meat\nGoods are fine honey\nLuxuries are mythical jewel\nDrama involves betrayal through brawl\nWoe is ongoing killing\nNews of market nostalgic",

Although they have a cynical eye they speak with a soothing poetic voice when not whispering to their apprentice (The Rune Knight) who speaks on their behalf most of the time. They very much treat their apprentice as a proud but stern parent would.\nThey are a human of science and facts. They despise Dewyn the Sage who stops the proper investigation into the “Temple”. They want to break the vassals so the religion can be stopped. They find this incredibly difficult to do as the religious are so irrational so rational plans seldom seem to work.\nThe Moat Knight grew up as part of The Itinerant Realm. Constantly travelling they value friendship over places. However, they stay here as the same realm (The Eminent Realm) who destroyed his family’s realm is now trying to invade their new realm. The Moat Knight grew up with The Shield Knight and they are lovers and regularly write to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4-1\nApprentice scholar at Bochordil (she/her)\nYoung\nCrystal flask: If shaken gives of a gentle light, If smashed the next season arrives\n\nThe Rune Knight is a tall woman wearing a deep purple dress covered in runes of metallic thread. She speaks with a poetic whisper matching her cautious nature. She sees herself as a peacemaker and bridge between the knights and The Emerald Lights.

    "text": "Pronounced: Kla-cleen\nEtymology: Claeg is old english for clay, Caislean is irish for castle\nLocation: R8-C8\nImportance: Holds the seat of power\n\nAtop a steep hill of red clay smothered in rusted clovers proudly sits Klaegcasleen, the seat of power.\n\n\nA massive oval based cylindrical citadel sits within the dwelling’s walls. From afar the settlement blends into the sky due to the teal coloured bricks that make up the walls and citadel. These building blocks of clay are incredibly strong and cause the internal temperature of the castle to stay at a splendid cool temperature all year round. This is enjoyed by all locals and visitors.\nThe ground hall of the citadel is dominated by a great hall. This is a public space used for various events such as feasts, theatre, workshops, lectures and more. Some say this is pure generosity, others say this is to prevent unseen assassinations.\n\n\n\nAlthough the foundation seems to be a clay hill it is actually on top of a limestone outcropping of caves, the clay sides installed and maintained during periods without war. Apart from shelter the citizens also make use of the caves’ water. A hallowed fountain sits prominently as the centre piece of the Bailey. The site was chosen due to its inexplicable existence.\nThe fountain’s water never stops flowing and many say it will outlive even the realm. Little is known about the marble fountain’s origins with its carved imagery of fairies and pond weeds indicating it belonged to a long forgotten time. The townspeople treasure it as they use the impossibly pure and clear water for pottery and paint making.\n\n\n\nThere are many potters, creating all sorts of ceramics such as bricks, tableware, and vases. The pottery is known for its strength and simple beauty. However, a rift amongst the potters has recently occurred.\nWhere once only blue clay was used, now new artists are using red clay.\n\nThe Gaulters believe the blue clay is calming and that the red clay should be left for the land, so life can grow on it.\nThe Rusthands say that blue clay is now hard to find and therefore too expensive, preventing new potters from starting their craft.\n\n\n\n\nThe citadel boasts amazing paintings of people. All across the realms the paintings are praised and coveted for the life likeness of its subjects. Unfortunately this is due to their use of minimum (red lead) that leads to lead poisoning in the preparers and artists.\nChronic poisoning displays as agitation, irritability, vision disorders, hypertension, and a grayish facial hue. Older skilled painters are kept on the 1st floor of the citadel where they only use blue candles to light the rooms (hiding their grey facial hues). They only paint in the sun room, believing sunlight is the best light for skin.\n\n\n\nDue to the location on a peninsula the dwelling is able to trade with other realms via the sea. Currently there is much jubilation about spiced cakes. Otherwise they eat various plant foods and seafood.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately the holding is always hit with a massive storm, known as brickfall, at the start of Tithe. The citizens hide in the caves until the 2 day storm passes at which much damage will have occurred to the wooden homes due to various bricks from the wall and citadel falling on them. Overall the walls provide more safety as a windshield than destruction but many believe not enough is done to prevent bricks from falling.\nThis has led to 2 sides in the leaders of the dwelling who also act as the seat of power.\nThe Repairers faction believe things are best as they are. Anything to stop bricks from falling would require more effort than laying in the new bricks and fixing damages. They oppose the Reinforcement plans as it would ruin the simple beauty of Klaecasleen for Eldermass. It contains the following members:\n\nThe Ghoul Knight: Leader of the Seat of power\nThe Fanged Knight: Steward of Klaegcasleen\nThe Horn Knight: Marshal of Klaegcasleen\n\nThe Reinforcement faction believe red clay should be laid over the walls and castle to prevent brickfalls. Carrying this out during Eldermass would allow the clay to dry in the sun. Additionally, they propose artists to create more complex art through the reinforcing clay. This clay would then be washed away and added back to the land through the rains of the rest of the year. It contains the following members:\n\nThe War Knight: Domain ruler of Klaegcasleen\nThe Bone Knight: Envoy of the realm\n\nThere have been various assassination attempts on The Ghoul Knight and on The War Knight.\n\n\n\n\nHolding features welcoming citadel\nBailey includes hallowed fountain\nKeep holds Guards with Antlers decor\nFood is spiced cake\nGoods are strong pottery\nLuxuries are hazardous artwork\nDrama involves Redemption and Assassin\nWoe is Looming Storm\nNews of Market Divided",

These building blocks of clay are incredibly strong and cause the internal temperature of the castle to stay at a splendid cool temperature all year round. This is enjoyed by all locals and visitors.\nThe ground hall of the citadel is dominated by a great hall. This is a public space used for various events such as feasts, theatre, workshops, lectures and more. Some say this is pure generosity, others say this is to prevent unseen assassinations.",

Apart from shelter the citizens also make use of the caves’ water. A hallowed fountain sits prominently as the centre piece of the Bailey. The site was chosen due to its inexplicable existence.\nThe fountain’s water never stops flowing and many say it will outlive even the realm. Little is known about the marble fountain’s origins with its carved imagery of fairies and pond weeds indicating it belonged to a long forgotten time. The townspeople treasure it as they use the impossibly pure and clear water for pottery and paint making.",

The citizens hide in the caves until the 2 day storm passes at which much damage will have occurred to the wooden homes due to various bricks from the wall and citadel falling on them. Overall the walls provide more safety as a windshield than destruction but many believe not enough is done to prevent bricks from falling.\nThis has led to 2 sides in the leaders of the dwelling who also act as the seat of power.\nThe Repairers faction believe things are best as they are. Anything to stop bricks from falling would require more effort than laying in the new bricks and fixing damages. They oppose the Reinforcement plans as it would ruin the simple beauty of Klaecasleen for Eldermass. It contains the following members:\n\nThe Ghoul Knight: Leader of the Seat of power\nThe Fanged Knight: Steward of Klaegcasleen\nThe Horn Knight: Marshal of Klaegcasleen\n\nThe Reinforcement faction believe red clay should be laid over the walls and castle to prevent brickfalls. Carrying this out during Eldermass would allow the clay to dry in the sun. Additionally, they propose artists to create more complex art through the reinforcing clay. This clay would then be washed away and added back to the land through the rains of the rest of the year. It contains the following members:\n\nThe War Knight: Domain ruler of Klaegcasleen\nThe Bone Knight: Envoy of the realm\n\nThere have been various assassination attempts on The Ghoul Knight and on The War Knight.",
