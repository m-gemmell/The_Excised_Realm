A young potter who was apprentice to [Bray](/cast/klaegcasleen_vassals.qmd#bray). They have a cautious and abrasive voice.
They wear thick wool clothing under their comfortable overalls.

They have a strong tone with intense mannerisms.
After working in Fabriknock to fix the forge building they decided to stay.
This is because they are interested in fishing and excited to learn.
Fabriknock has greatly expanded its fishing due to the new fishing/boat house built in 4-11 due to the Silk Knight's service, [see session 3](/sessions/session_three.qmd).
