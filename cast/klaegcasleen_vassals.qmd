An old potter, he is melancholic yet always talking. 
His finger tips are stained blue through his constant use of blue clay.
He is part of the [Gaulters faction](/holdings/klaegcasleen.qmd#potters).

He speaks with a flat tone and wears wild clothing.

He asked the knights to check the cliffs at 10-9 for blue clay.
The Silk Knight and Salt Knight set up a successful blue clay mining operation at the cliffs through pilgrimage and service [Session three](/sessions/session_three.qmd).

Their apprentice was [Hygo](/cast/fabriknock_vassals.qmd#hygo) who now lives in [Fabriknock](/holdings/fabriknock.qmd).
