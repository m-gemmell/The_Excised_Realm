- 3-4
- Ruler of [Bochordil](/holdings/bochordil.qmd) (they/them)
- Old
- Parent of [The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight)

A weathered individual covered in intricate tattoos of a plethora of languages over their arms, legs and head. Although they have a cynical eye they speak with a soothing poetic voice when not whispering to their apprentice ([The Rune Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-rune-knight)) who speaks on their behalf most of the time. They very much treat their apprentice as a proud but stern parent would. 

They are a human of science and facts. They despise [Salvia the Sage](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd#salvia-the-sage) who stops the proper investigation into the “Temple”. They want to break the vassals so the religion can be stopped. They find this incredibly difficult to do as the religious are so irrational so rational plans seldom seem to work.

[The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) grew up as part of The Itinerant Realm (see [History](/history/first_age.qmd)). Constantly travelling they value friendship over places. However, they stay here as the same realm (The Eminent Realm) who destroyed his family’s realm is now trying to invade their new realm. [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) grew up with [The Shield Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-shield-knight) and they are lovers and regularly write to each other.

- 4-1
- Apprentice scholar at [Bochordil](/holdings/bochordil.qmd) (she/her)
- Young
- Crystal flask: If shaken gives of a gentle light, If smashed the next season arrives

[The Rune Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-rune-knight) is a tall woman wearing a deep purple dress covered in runes of metallic thread. She speaks with a poetic whisper matching her cautious nature.
She sees herself as a peacemaker and bridge between the knights and The Emerald Lights. Though she has currently made little ground.

She has been raised kindly by [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) and [The Shield Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-shield-knight). Her parents, previously knights, were executed by [The Ghoul Knight](/cast/klaegcasleen_knights.qmd#the-ghoul-knight). 
The stated reason was treason but was actually due to personal conflict with her parents and [The Ghoul Knight](/cast/klaegcasleen_knights.qmd#the-ghoul-knight). 
This has caused The Rune Knight to become a people pleaser and try to stay out of sight by escaping into the books at [Bochordil](/holdings/bochordil.qmd).

[The Rune Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-rune-knight) sees [The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight) as her sister but gives her space since [The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight) seems to hate her.

- 6-3
- Ruler of [Fabriknock](/holdings/fabriknock.qmd) (she/her)
- Young
- Daughter of [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) and [The Shield Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-shield-knight)
- Useful stick: terrifies snake, eels, and worms but only works in bright sunlight

A young but wary knight. She does not know who to trust and so is very hesitant to make decisions based on information given by others. This along with their relaxed attitude irritates their subjects. They are often found sitting in the forge reading books, the loud noise stopping others from talking to her.

[The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight) is the child of [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) they studied at Bochordil. They hate [The Rune Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-rune-knight) as [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) treats The Rune Knight like their child. [The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight) was pampered at [Bochordil](/holdings/bochordil.qmd) but now they have to work hard as the ruler. They wish they could go back to studying books.

However, they are quite lively these days as weird goings on with killings are happening in their holding. This allows them to investigate.

## The Shield Knight

- 2-8
- “Ruler” of [Inis Ocular](/holdings/inis_ocular.qmd) (she/her)
- Old
- Mother of The Rune Knight
- Soothing salve: aroma of meat, side effect of lethargy

[The Shield Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-shield-knight) is a weathered old woman wearing crude dresses. She only wears dresses from her lost realm, emblazoned with parallel lines that connect, representing the circular path of their previous nomadic life. This is the same realm [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) came from, The Itinerant Realm (see [History](/history/first_age.qmd)).

Her voice is strong and terse yet her writing voice is sweet and gentle. She regularly writes to her lover ([The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight)) and their daughter ([The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight)). Although she knows [The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight) hates [The Rune Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-rune-knight) she is an adoring ally of [The Rune Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-rune-knight). Nothing would make her happier than seeing those two acting like loving sisters rather than fighting sisters.

Above all [The Shield Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-shield-knight) wishes for the “Temple” at [Bochordil](/holdings/bochordil.qmd) to be destroyed. Maybe then [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) would pay more attention to her and it would really stick it to the [Emerald Lights](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd).
