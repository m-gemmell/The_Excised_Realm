# The Emerald Lights

A religion that existed when these lands where still part of the Eminent Realm.
They praise the three emerald stars that lie at the very top of the night sky.
They know these as "The Emerald Eyes" as they watch the lands, never moving with the other stars.

The religion believes the deep purple metal structures through the lands are gifts from the Emerald Eyes.
These are indeed from the Emerald Eyes but not as gifts.
The Emerald Eyes are in fact from The Star Myth (3-4).

Structures include:

- [The Gates](/holdings/bochordil.qmd#gate) at [Bochordil](/holdings/bochordil.qmd)
- The Pyramid at Bochordil
- The Forge rod at Fabriknock

The religion is controlled by three main leaders, the Triad.
