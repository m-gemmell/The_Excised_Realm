# Bochordil

- Pronounced: Back-or-dill
- Etymology: Bochord is old english for library, aill is irish for cliff
- Location: R1-C5
- Importance: Library and protection from invaders from the north (The Eminent Realm)

The __Tower of Bochordil__ is roughly cut out of the __cliff face__ of a __crag__. 
It is easy to miss if you don’t know its location.

## Negative space of the crag

The __bailey__ of Bochordil fits in a __perfectly cylindrical cut out of the crag__. T
he cut out runs from the top of the crag to a perfectly level circle on the ground. 
No one knows how this occurred but many people believe it was through divine intervention.

## Gate

The holding’s base is not quite a perfect circle with the imperfection caused by the space that allows escape from the holding. 
There lies a __two doored gate__, as tall as three men and as thick as a mule from nose to tail. 
It is made from a__deep purple metal__ only occasionally found in __rocks__ that have __dropped__ from the __heavens__ and other __mysterious structures__. 
Atop the gate there are always guards __wary of invasion__ from the __north__.

## Pyramid

In the centre of the Bailey lies a tall but __thin triangular based pyramid__. 
Made of the same __deep purple metal__ as the gate it is seen as a __divine gift__. 
It is used as a __church__ for the [Emerald Lights](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd). 
The religious leader of this holding is [Salvia the Sage](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd#salvia-the-sage).

## The Transposed Tower

The Tower of Bochordil is known as __The Transposed Tower__. 
Rather than the tower being a cylindrical structure with empty space around it, the tower’s rooms are __carved into the rock surrounding the empty space of the cylindrical bailey__. 
The Transposed Tower’s windows looking over the bailey and its dominating temple. 

There are __various floors__ filled with __books and scholars__. 
There is only one __door for entry__ from the bailey that leads directly into the __throne room__. 

In the throne room lies a __throne__ that would be called __plain__ if it were not made entirely out of __emerald__. 
The __walls__ of the room itself are plastered with __large pages depicting maps, treaties, and stories__. 

Sitting upon the throne is [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight), always reading and writing even when speaking or listening to others. Always at their service is their apprentice [The Rune Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-rune-knight), managing the tactical affairs as [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) manages the strategic. 

[The Mule Knight](/cast/wandering_knights.qmd#the-mule-knight) studied at The Transposed Tower and has strong connections with the Knights and scholars there.

Only [The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight), [The Rune Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-rune-knight), or [Salvia the Sage](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd#salvia-the-sage) can grant access to the library of the Tower.

## Geography

Unfortunately their location's geography __does not promote food production__ and so they mostly rely on __fermented fish__ from the fishing in the __south east peninsula__. 
The denizens set up the holding as a __brilliant choke point__ to repel the constant invasions of The Eminent Realm who would use it as a perfect staging ground for a war with The Excised Realm. 
People stay for the accumulated knowledge or the holy structure.

## Spies and mead

There are __spies__ of __other realms__ in The Transposed Tower. 
[The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) and [The Rune Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-rune-knight) know this. 
They have their __own spies bribe them__ with their __knowledge__ to share knowledge of the other realms. 

Most importantly the spies/scholars of The Transposed Tower are able to make an __intoxicating mead__ that is __made nowhere else__ due to their access to __Trillium wellsii__.

## Trillium wellsii

At the top of the crag is the only occurrence of the flower __Trillium wellsii__ (H.G Wells wrote War of the Worlds). 
It has three curling stems that connect to one head with 3 petals. 
The Petals are a deep dark iridescent colour and on closer inspection look almost glass like.

Bees are kept at the top of The Transposed Tower giving them access to the flowers.
The honey of these bees are used to create the __intoxicating mead__.

After drinking the mead you have __lucid dreams that you remember with utmost clarity__. 
Unfortunately you __forget everything__ you did whilst you were __drunk__ and are very likely to __answer all questions truthfully__.  
This is made with __normal bees__ that use the __pollen from a flower__ that came from the __heavens__. 

The bee’s __royal jelly__ is also used to create a __flawless floral perfume__ that is used to trade with other realms.
