# Fabriknock

- Pronounced: Fa-bree-knock
- Etymology: Fabir is old french for forge, knock is irish for hill
- Location: R5-C12
- Importance: Primary source of forged metals in the realm

## Forge

Constant hammering rings through the bailey. 
It originates from the __blacksmiths__ in a __large white chimney like building__. 
A __thick deep purple metal rod__ runs __far__ into the __earth__ providing a __mighty heat__. 

Many blacksmiths work here due to the free heat. 
Aside from the source of heat there is nothing else special about the forge and its output.

## Workshops

To match the blacksmiths many __rivalling workshops__ exist in __Fabriknock__. 
They make all manner of contraptions and jewellery from the metals of the forge. 
They are especially fond of using the green pearls from the green bees.

The various wares are sold in market stalls surrounding the forge.
The realm's Merchants come here to buy these goods and then sell them at [Inis Ocular](/holdings/inis_ocular.qmd).

## Trillium baumuum

Strange radial __3 petalled and 3 stemmed__ flowers exist in the surrounding area (__Trillium baumuum__; trillium is a flower, Frank Baum wrote the wizard of oz). 
Although they are beautiful with their __emerald petals__ and __glass like__ appearance they are __forbidden to be picked__. 

The flowers are used by the __bee keepers__. 
The bees that use its __pollen__ produce a <span style='color: #dfff00;'>chartreuse</span> __honey__ that is sold as a luxury. 
Beehives are built into the wood walls of the town so the beekeepers can extract honey from inside the walls without walking on the flowers.

Additionally, bees end up growing a __green emerald inside their body__. 
These are extracted and used by the various makers in the workshops. 

## Rainbow keep

Inside the __Keep of multi coloured rocks__ they keep a __reliquary__. 
This is the __whole skeleton of the Green Eyed Seer__. 
It is of high significance for the [Emerald Lights](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd) religion who was seen as a sort of Demigod for their religion. 

The skeleton looks like that of a __“little grey man”__. 
It is protected by [The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight). 
[The Moat Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) sent it to be protected by [The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight) as a power move against [Salvia the Sage](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd#salvia-the-sage). 
[The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight) is [The Moat Knight’s](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-moat-knight) child.

## Tensions and the sun religion

The __denizens__ of the holding have __fractured__. 
There have been __brawls and killings__. 
It seems senseless to the guards and those in the Keep. 
But it is not senseless. 

__Many__ of the holding want to __steal the skeleton__ of the Green Seer to give to The Eagle (myth).
This seems to be turning into a __new religion that worships the sun__. 

The other side follows the [Emerald Lights](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd) religion and so do not want their reliquary to be given away.
