- Location:
- Importance: Trade port for the realm to other realms across the sea. Trade only occurs here to quarantine merchants from other realms.

## Port

The port is bustling with trade.
Overseas merchants are not allowed to go inland, instead trade occurring here.

## Observatory

Inis Ocular is known for its __observatory__ and has been __taken over__ by [The Emerald Lights](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd). 
They use the observatory to try to watch the emerald lights in the sky. 
The leader is [Mentha the Mint](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd#mentha-the-mint) (they/them).

## Hallowed Garden

The official ruler, [The Shield Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-shield-knight), lives in a __small garden house__ in the __hallowed garden__.

In the garden, grows the alien flower, __Trillium blaschkanum__ (Blaschka known for the glass flowers). 
Each flower is __split into three from the stem to the head__. 
__Each third__ has __one triangular petal__ and __triangular leaves__. 
The thirds are __connected__ by __thin fibres__. 

All of it looks quite __glass-like__ and __one third__ is coloured __emerald__, another third a __dark iridescent purple__, and the third a __yellow colour__. 

## Textiles

The __leaves__ of __Trillium Blaschkanum__ are fed to __silk moth larvae__ producing __green, purple, or yellow silk__ depending on the leaves they eat.
These are used by local textile workers to make very expensive clothing.
The silks possibly have other effects.

Strangely there are also a lot of leather workers on the island.
Lots of leather is received from other realms through trade as there is little cattle farming in The Excised Realm.

## Blackmail

[The Shield Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-shield-knight) is blackmailed by [Mentha the Mint](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd#mentha-the-mint) to let [The Emerald Lights](/cast/the_emerald_lights.qmd) rule. 
This is because they have evidence of [The Shield Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-shield-knight) skimming wealth off the top from the trade that passes through.
