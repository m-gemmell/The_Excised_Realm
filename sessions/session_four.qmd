# Session Four

## Plan

- Drama in court
- Possibly Knights will go to 10-11, a site where The child is.

## Start scenes

### The Story Knight and The War Knight

> Frost and crumbled clay crunches under your feet.
> The blue and brown over the salt and pepper ground adds a contrast of beauty to the wreckage of the surrounding buildings.
> Workers move quickly repairing the large citadel with teal bricks.
> They hurry hoping to fix their own abodes before the chill of winter makes itself at home.

> Beside you walks a tall knight adorned in a jade gambeson.
> Her silver hair falls across her like ashened willow leaves. 
> Surveilling the work and damage she wears an unsuppressed frown before she turns to you.
> She truly looks at you.
> As she does you see the eyes of someone whose hopes have been been constantly stamped on but never extinguished.
> With a flat unreadable voice she speaks with you.

- [The War Knight](/cast/klaegcasleen_knights.qmd#the-war-knight)
- Asks The Story Knight what they think of the scene.
- Will speak of the Schism and Brickfall.
- Will ask The Story Knight to try to figure out the power of The Horn Knight.
- Lastly: Will tell The Story Knight that The Ghoul Knight is holding her son hostage.

### The Leaf Knight and The Ghoul Knight

> The boat sways gently in the bay.
> On one side snow topped cliffs, the other rolling hills.
> Across from you is The Ghoul Knight.
> He wears white furs on top of crocodilian leathers on top of purple silks.
> Even stranger than him is a sullen boy quietly and meticulously inspecting a wooden lion cub.

> The Ghoul Knight invites you to fish.
> With rod in hand he reels them in as you wait with net in hand.
> Every caught fish is judged by The Ghoul Knight.
> Whatever the decision he throws it into the air for one of three fates.
> It lands in the water to freedom.
> It is caught by a guard in one of the various boats.
> Or, it is shot by one of the many archers.
> The signals are imperceptible to you.
> During all this he talks at you.

- [The Ghoul Knight](/cast/klaegcasleen_knights.qmd#the-ghoul-knight)
- Tells his disappointment of what took place in Fabriknock.
- The Emerald Lights are becoming bold, Lavandula talks of creating a place at the seat of power for her and then having someone replace their role, making a possible tetrad (4).
    - The Ghoul Knight is wary of The Violet Knight who has not been part of Spectremass yet (not made vow of loyalty to the kingdom).
- Although Fabriknock found sources of food for itself and the Tithe Bochrodil and Inis Ocular were not so lucky and are struggling.
    - Bochordil will be weakened and more susceptible to attack from The Eminent realm
    - Trade with other realms will suffer through Inis Ocular having to eat the food they would otherwise trade.
- Mission request: Fabriknock is a lost cause. Discreetly remove Mentha from Inis Ocular. In return I will send The Rune Knight to rule Inis Ocular and send The Shield Knight to Bochordil.
- Ends in a coughing fit which the boy does not react too.

### The Salt Knight and The Silk Knight

> The waves gently rock your boat as you inspect the cliffs, hoping to spot a blue clay.
> Behind you barely see the teal bricked citadel of Klaegcasleen and ahead you spot the observatory of Inis Ocular.
> The days are getting shorter, the sun getting dimmer, whilst those four emerald stars get brighter and impede on the day sky.

> You both, The Salt Knight and The Silk Knight, sit in one boat.
> In another is The Bone Knight, her afro bobbing with the waves, beside Bray, the old melancholic master potter.

> The Salt Knight, running their fingers in the cold and salty water gets a sudden feeling.
> Signalling to stop the boats, you all disembark.
> The Silk Knight, finding a lump of clay , uses her silk like a cheese cloth.
> The cross section reveals a blue clay with a preserved ammonite, perfectly cut in 2.

> Beaming, Bray rushes over, digging out the fossils and dropping them to the ground.
> He ecstatically digs deeper, all the clay blue, and announces they have found what they needed.
> The Bone Knight quietly picks up the fossils giving you one half each and whispers "good job".

- After revelry [The Bone Knight](/cast/wandering_knights.qmd#the-bone-knight) enters the shared tent of the Knights.
- She offers to give them information if they trade a bone for a bone (1 trade each).
    - She will give them a piece of information about one Knight or location they want.
    - She has her box of bones and her Bone Magnate ability
    - Knights: Ghoul, War, Fanged, Horn, Mule, Shield, Rune, Moat
