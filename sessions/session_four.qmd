# Session Four

## Plan

- Drama in court
- Possibly Knights will go to 10-11, a site where The child is.

## Start scenes

### The Story Knight and The War Knight

> Frost and crumbled clay crunches under your feet.
> The blue and brown over the salt and pepper ground adds a contrast of beauty to the wreckage of the surrounding buildings.
> Workers move quickly repairing the large citadel with teal bricks.
> They hurry hoping to fix their own abodes before the chill of winter makes itself at home.

> Beside you walks a tall knight adorned in a jade gambeson.
> Her silver hair falls across her like ashened willow leaves. 
> Surveilling the work and damage she wears an unsuppressed frown before she turns to you.
> She truly looks at you.
> As she does you see the eyes of someone whose hopes have been been constantly stamped on but never extinguished.
> With a flat unreadable voice she speaks with you.

- [The War Knight](/cast/klaegcasleen_knights.qmd#the-war-knight)
- Asks The Story Knight what they think of the scene.
- Will speak of the Schism and Brickfall.
- Will ask The Story Knight to try to figure out the power of The Horn Knight.
- Lastly: Will tell The Story Knight that The Ghoul Knight is holding her son hostage.

### The Leaf Knight and The Ghoul Knight

> The boat sways gently in the bay.
> On one side snow topped cliffs, the other rolling hills.
> Across from you is The Ghoul Knight.
> He wears white furs on top of crocodilian leathers on top of purple silks.
> Even stranger than him is a sullen boy quietly and meticulously inspecting a wooden lion cub.

> The Ghoul Knight invites you to fish.
> With rod in hand he reels them in as you wait with net.
> Every caught fish is judged by The Ghoul Knight.
> Whatever the decision he throws it into the air for one of three fates.
> It lands in the water to freedom.
> It is caught by a guard in one of the various boats.
> Or, it is shot by one of the many archers.
> The signals are imperceptible to you.
> During all this he talks at you.

- [The Ghoul Knight](/cast/klaegcasleen_knights.qmd#the-ghoul-knight)
- Tells his disappointment of what took place in Fabriknock.
- The Emerald Lights are becoming bold, Lavandula talks of creating a place at the seat of power for her and then having someone replace their role, making a possible tetrad (4).
    - The Ghoul Knight is wary of The Violet Knight who has not been part of Spectremass yet (not made vow of loyalty to the kingdom).
- Although Fabriknock found sources of food for itself and the Tithe Bochrodil and Inis Ocular were not so lucky and are struggling.
    - Bochordil will be weakened and more susceptible to attack from The Eminent realm
    - Trade with other realms will suffer through Inis Ocular having to eat the food they would otherwise trade.
- Mission request: Fabriknock is a lost cause. Discreetly remove Mentha from Inis Ocular. In return I will send The Rune Knight to rule Inis Ocular and send The Shield Knight to Bochordil.
- Ends in a coughing fit which the boy does not react too.

### The Salt Knight and The Silk Knight

> The waves gently rock your boat as you inspect the cliffs, hoping to spot a blue clay.
> Behind, you barely see the teal bricked citadel of Klaegcasleen and ahead you spot the observatory of Inis Ocular.
> The days are getting shorter, the sun getting dimmer, whilst those four emerald stars get brighter and impede on the heavens.

> You both, The Salt Knight and The Silk Knight, sit in one boat.
> In another is The Bone Knight, her afro bobbing with the waves, beside Bray, the old melancholic master potter.

> The Salt Knight, running their fingers in the cold and salty water gets a sudden feeling.
> Signalling to stop the boats, you all disembark.
> The Silk Knight, finding a lump of clay , uses her silk like cheese wire.
> The cross section reveals a blue clay with a preserved ammonite, perfectly cut in 2.

> Beaming, Bray rushes over, digging out the fossils and dropping them to the ground.
> He ecstatically digs deeper, all the clay blue, and announces they have found what they needed.
> The Bone Knight quietly picks up the fossils giving you one half each and whispers "good job".

- After revelry [The Bone Knight](/cast/wandering_knights.qmd#the-bone-knight) enters the shared tent of the Knights.
- She offers to give them information if they trade a bone for a bone (1 trade each).
    - She will give them a piece of information about one Knight or location they want.
    - She has her box of bones and her Bone Magnate ability
    - Knights: Ghoul, War, Fanged, Horn, Mule, Shield, Rune, Moat

## Plan for session

- Flashback
    - When the Mule knight first brought them to Klaegcasleen they had their portraits drawn.
    - The Knights have their portrait painted (see [paintings](/holdings/klaegcasleen.qmd#paintings))
- Go through the three events of Winter, allowing scenes of the Knights going through courtly drama.
- Feast of the moon
    - "Ceremony: The wisest elders of the Realm are gathered to speak of the glorious dead, those who built the world as we know it. The ruler may honour a few of the recently deceased to be named amongst these legendary figures."
        - The Emerald lights list their followers who died at Fabriknock. [The Fanged Knight](/cast/klaegcasleen_knights.qmd#the-fanged-knight) list the others who died at Farbiknock. 
    - "Spectacle: Great bonfires are lit, believing the dead can see the living world if they burn bright enough. People are encouraged to shout messages to departed loved ones and to curse vanquished enemies."
        - Bonfires at the bottom of the hill of Klaegcasleen. Dead can see the living world due to bonfires. People shout messages to departed loved ones and curse vanquished enemies.
    - "Revelry: All are encouraged to act as if it were their last night alive, so no amount of decadence is off the table. Of all the feasts, this one is especially suited to the dark."
        - All eat at the great hall in blue candle light.
        - Music, shows and plays take place on the theatre-in-the-round. Ask players for one show each.
- Time skip. Each player gets a scene they want to enact. Ask what they want to discover and ensure they receive some form of answer.
- Kindlemass
    - "Ceremony: In the morning every fire in the home is lit, as the dull midday sees the doors theatrically cast open for any guests who wish to visit. The rest defies planning, and friends and enemies alike use this custom as a means to spring surprises."
    - "Spectacle: Hosts are expected to provide gifts to visitors, with the most elaborate gifts strategically held back for the most important guests. Hosts are also expected to humble themselves with an embarrassing performance or game, with rulers often acting as servant to their own vassals! The wise know that there is a sweet spot with how much to play along with this custom."
    - "Revelry: While quantity of food may be limited, presentation is key here, with even humble provisions dressed up to resemble mythical beasts or famous landmarks. Strong, hot drinks are the order of the day. While the doors are open to all, only a few are typically invited to stay the night."
