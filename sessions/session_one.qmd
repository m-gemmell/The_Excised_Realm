# Session One

## Introductory poem

<center>

**Seer**

Before you stands a human, yes,<br> But also more and also less.<br> They'll annoint you as their one true knight,<br> Wielding significant might.

Though their eyes are faded,<br> you'll boldly go forth with arms abladed.<br> For you know their vision is clear,<br> And so they'll be your wisened seer.

Now step fourth and take the oath,<br> Seer and knight will say it both.<br> The seer recites it all in guide,<br> What you repeat with whole body and mind.

Seek the myths<br> Honour the seers<br> Protect the realm

-   They meet up with Mr. Something (the guard leader) who tells them more
-   They go see Crabbe (they/them) the local leader of the Emerald Lights.

-   They find a gentle pit surrounded by tombstones
-   The Silk knight decodes the braille on the tombstones
    -   “Here lies the steed of the green eyed seer, unlike any other steed. Once twin of the tower at Bachordil”
-   At the bottom of the pit lies a tower partly submerged and sideways. It is made of the same deep purple metal of the heat producing rod at the forge of Fabriknock. It has three long bird like legs (see the walking towers from the Star Myth (3-4)).
-   Story, Salt, and Violet enter the tower through a large crack on its side
-   The Story Knight finds a football sized spherical emerald with an inner orange sphere. He cracks it open and an orange goo comes out, merging with the emerald inner walls of the tower.
-   With a delayed reaction they realise the crack is closing and they rush to escape. They do so but The Salt Knight is almost crushed.
