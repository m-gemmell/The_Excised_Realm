# Session three

## Plan

- Seasonal time skip choice
    - Pilgrimage, Courtesy, or service (pg. 17)
- Feast of the stars
    - Night of honours, unions, and contests
    - Takes place outside at the town centre.
    - Currently the walls of the forge have been full taken down so they can be rebuilt
    - The feast begins at sunset with the Green Eyed seer leaving to the skies
    - Ask Foxtrot if they want a new knight
        - If so The Leaf knight will challenge them to a duel to claim rulership of Fabriknock
        - Otherwise will still challenge for a duel but just for glory
