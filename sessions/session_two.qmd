- Although things have been quite quiet now they each get to ask a question from their investigations
- [The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight) has left to [Klaegcasleen](/holdings/klaegcasleen.qmd) to renew their vow of loyalty to [The Ghoul Knight](/cast/klaegcasleen_knights.qmd#the-ghoul-knight) as part of Spectremass

### Inciting event

- The knights will awaken to a massive crashing sound
- The Forge’s chimney like roof have collapsed as the green eyed seers steed hovers over the forge. Its 3 legs connect to the black rod (it is absorbing energy). The forges cool down by afternoon
- Chaos ensues as people try to help others and figure out what's going on around the forge
- The Emerald lights followers surround the forge praying and thanking their god
- The Eagle followers use this opportunity to try to secretly storm the keep and steal the reliquary to give to the Eagle. They will go armed and they are able to escape through the north wall of the town through one of the empty beehive holes.

    - A Mob/warband of armed villager arrive (militia)
    - The knights take the skeleton and rush up the stairs of the keep
    - The Salt knight washes the militia down the stairs with her everlasting flask
    - They reach a window at the back of the castle and call for their horses
    - The militia catches up but the knights manage to push them down the stairs with mighty force
    - This gives them enough time for the horses to arrive and let them jump out the window to escape

A deep dark forest with strange rustling sounds
On their way to the Tangle Seer's Sanctum they hear multiple strikes of lightning
They find the Tangled Seers sanctum has been attacked by the Tower
ALl dead except the seer
With some water of the Everlasting flask and teamwork they manage to rescue the tangled seer
It gives them guidance saying to get rid of The Green Eyed Seer's steed is by giving the bones to the steed or to the eagle

They go to the hills to offer the bones to the steed
It arrives and takes the bones
In the tower the "seer" reforms from interior of the tower as a blob like form
It is happy with the knights and becomes more human looking to gift them a boon
The ask for the murder of the eagle
Using an emerald light it attracts the eagle and strikes down the wounded bird with a lightning bolt
The knights have resolved The Eagle myth
