- They have been resting a eating the <span style='color: #dfff00;'>chartreuse</span> __honey__, they are given abode at The Rainbow keep
- Although things have been quite quiet now they each get to ask a question from their investigations
- [The Leaf Knight](/cast/other_holding_knights.qmd#the-leaf-knight) has left to [Klaegcasleen](/holdings/klaegcasleen.qmd) to renew their vow of loyalty to [The Ghoul Knight](/cast/klaegcasleen_knights.qmd#the-ghoul-knight) as part of Spectremass

Inciting event

- The knights will awaken to a massive crashing sound
- The Forge’s chimney like roof have collapsed as the green eyed seers steed hovers over the forge. Its 3 legs connect to the black rod (it is absorbing energy). The forges cool down by afternoon
- Chaos ensues as people try to help others and figure out what's going on around the forge
- The Emerald lights followers surround the forge praying and thanking their god
- The Eagle followers use this opportunity to try to secretly storm the keep and steal the reliquary to give to the Eagle. They will go armed and they are able to escape through the north wall of the town through one of the empty beehive holes.
